# ðŸ–– Hello,
I am Max. A middle-aged human being.
I am fascinated by technology and programming. I love GNU/Linux and its ideology. My friends call me a geek. Just kidding. I don't have any friends. Because everyone says I'm a nerd, but I'm not. I have a list of 31 reasons why I'm not. Now, no kidding: what I wrote above has no effect on my soft and hard skills or my experience. I am a professional with 10 years of work under my belt.


***What I am doing?***

..The road arises under the footsteps of the walker.
Overcoming obstacles to become a great DevOps engineer. So far, so successful.


***Stack***

Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, PostgreSQL, Django, Flask, FastAPI, CI\CD, Git, Gitlab, Jenkins, Grafana, Prometheus, ELK, Zabbix, Nginx, Draw.io, Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, Gradle, Graylog, Tomcat, Sentry, HAProxy, Bootstrap, UiKit, SemanticUI, Vue.js, Selenium
