# Hello! I’m Python/JS Developer
My name is Max and I am from Moscow.
I love Python and its ideology very much. Afraid of JavaScript, but I respect its capabilities.
My GitHub profile is still empty, I have used it for many years as a bookmark service for interesting libraries and projects. Now I am working on showing my projects here.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my personal blog website.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go
- 💬 Ask me about data extracting and Django/Selenium/Puppeteer/Scrapy
- ⚡ Fun fact: My friends say I'm a bore, but I have a list of 28 reasons why I'm not.
