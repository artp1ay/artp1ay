# 🖖 Hello,
I am Max. A middle-aged human being.
I am fascinated by technology and programming. I love GNU/Linux and its ideology. My friends call me a geek. Just kidding. I don't have any friends. Because everyone says I'm a nerd, but I'm not. I have a list of 31 reasons why I'm not. Now, no kidding: what I wrote above has no effect on my soft and hard skills or my experience. I am a professional with 15 years of work under my belt.
